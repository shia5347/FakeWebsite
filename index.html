<a>"Dont a few mistakes and bam! Just like that everything went down from there. I was divorced, lonely and felt humiliated. Felt degraded, confused and lost living on the streets. It was difficult to find my way, miserably looking for a job. I finally found a job but was still living on the streets. Thanks to lime I am now able to afford a cheap home and am slowly paying off the rent."</a>
